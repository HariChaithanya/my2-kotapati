###### My favourite vacation spot is pondicherry
Pondicherry, officially known as **Puducherry**, and commonly referred to as just Pondy, is **one of the seven Union Territories of India** which is bounded by the southern state of Tamil Nadu. This former *French colony* is a perfect amalgamation of the traditional Indian sensibilities and French architecture, making it a dreamy escape that offers the best of both worlds.
